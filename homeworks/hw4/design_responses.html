						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> This is the first time I learn that very accomplished and specific color accessibility standards for web design actually exist. And it's designers' responsibility to create accessible and inclusive products using different methods and apply certain rules.   </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> It gives me a sense of designing accessible products, prompting us not to forget to put our attention on those who may have disabilities. On this basis, it gives detailed instructions to make products more accessible: for example, increasing color contrast, using elements other than color to allow users to better interact with the site, etc. </p>
						</li>
