            I'm a BGA student. I think UC Berkeley is really a cool and lively place and I love all those buildings, trees, grass and squirrels in campus!
            My birthday is in May. I have a sweet tooth. My favorite movie is Interstellar. And I hope to have a great time at web design this semester!
