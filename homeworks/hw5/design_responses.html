                            <p>This article does not have much narratives. Instead, it shows many UI designs which allow me to experience a direct feeling of vitality and development.</p>

                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p>My favorite inspirations are "Add to Cart Interaction by Dannniel for Norde" and "Index&Sidebar Animation by Arvin". Add to cart Interaction let us freely adjust the shoe size and color style, and at the same time vividly display changes of shoes, so we do not have to get the real pair to see the effect. I really like shoe size adjusting interaction, sliding up and down to adjust the size is like using spiral micrometer in high school physics class. As for the Index&Sidebar design, I like how smooth it is when draging cards up and down. It's like all these cards are underneath water and connected by elastic ropes. When we drag one card, another card will also move in the same direction with a little delay. Very interesting!   </p>
